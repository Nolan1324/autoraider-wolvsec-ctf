<h2>Project 9001 - The Almighty Oracle</h2>

<p>
    There has been a lot of cutting edge research going on around using computers to read minds! You will be applying these techniques to read my mind by providing the answers to some yes/no questions about a given person in the world. Should be easy!
</p>

<p>
    This project will be written entirely in Javascript and will be submitted via text.

    Your code should correctly implement the <code>oracle(personId, questionNumber)</code> function. This function shall return the answer to the question indexed by <code>questionNumber</code> for the person indexed by <code>personIndex</code>. People on Earth are indexed by birth date, where <code>personIndex = 0</code> has the earliest birth date. Return the boolean <code>true</code> if the answer is "yes" and <code>false</code> if the answer is no. If <code>personId</code> is greater than <code>7754000</code>, then the person has not been born yet and you should return <code>false</code>. Each question is associated with a question number (starting at 0).
